## 15. FAQs

**Essential FAQs**:

**Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT?**
A: ChatGPT requires you to copy/paste content and loses context after a few messages. We automatically extract YouTube transcripts, scrape websites, parse PDFs, and keep everything organized on a visual canvas. The AI always has full context.

**Q: Do you train AI models on my data?**
A: No. Your canvases and conversations are private. We don't use your data for model training.

**Q: What happens when I run out of credits?**
A: You'll see a notification before you run out. Top up anytime with transparent pricing. Free tier includes enough credits for ~500 AI messages per month.

**Q: Can I use my own API keys for AI models?**
A: Not yet, but it's on our roadmap. Currently we handle all AI model access through our credit system.

**Q: How does team collaboration work?**
A: Create an organization, invite team members. Everyone with access to a canvas sees real-time updates. Anyone can continue any chat thread. Credits are shared at the org level.

**Q: What file types can I upload?**
A: PDFs work now. We're adding Google Docs, Word docs, images, and spreadsheets soon.

**Q: Is there a limit to canvas size?**
A: No. Canvases are infinite. Add as many nodes as you want.

**Q: Can I export my canvases?**
A: Yes. Export as JSON, PDF, or image. Chat transcripts export as markdown.

**Advanced/Positioning FAQs**:

**Q: Why not just use Miro/Figma + ChatGPT separately?**
A: You could, but you'd spend hours copying content between tools. We built the integration so AI natively understands your canvas context. Plus, Miro/Figma don't extract YouTube transcripts or scrape websites.

**Q: Is this for technical users only?**
A: No. If you can drag and drop files, you can use this. The infinite canvas might feel new for 5 minutes, then it's intuitive.

**Q: What's your uptime/reliability?**
A: Built on Convex (99.9% uptime). Real-time sync in <50ms. We've processed 50,000+ YouTube videos without issues.

**Q: Do you support SSO/SAML?**
A: Coming Q2 2025 for Organization plan.

**Q: What's your security/compliance situation?**
A: SOC 2 Type II in progress. GDPR compliant. Data encrypted at rest and in transit. Happy to fill out security questionnaires.

## 18. Founder's Letter (Optional)

**Option A - Origin Story**:

**Why We Built This**

I spent 3 years as a product manager at [Company]. Every week I'd watch 20+ competitor demo videos, read industry reports, analyze tweets.

My workflow was chaos: 15 browser tabs, copy-pasting transcripts into ChatGPT, losing context every 10 messages, starting over.

I thought: "AI is supposed to save time. Why am I doing so much manual work?"

That's when we started building. An infinite canvas where you drop content. AI that actually sees everything. Real-time collaboration so teams stop duplicating research.

We're not trying to replace human thinking. We're trying to amplify it.

If you've ever felt frustrated explaining context to AI for the 5th time, this is for you.

— [Founder Name]

**Option B - Vision-Focused**:

**The Future of AI Collaboration**

Most AI tools assume you work alone in a chat box. But real work is messy, collaborative, and multi-modal.

We believe the future of AI isn't just better models—it's better interfaces. Ones that match how you actually think and work.

That's why we built an infinite canvas, not another chat app. Visual organization + AI intelligence + team collaboration.

We're just getting started. This year: more integrations (TikTok, Instagram, Google Docs). Next year: multiplayer AI agents, canvas automation, API access.

If you want to shape where this goes, join us. Your feedback drives our roadmap.

— [Founder Name]

**Option C - Problem-Obsessed**:

**I Hate Wasted Time**

Every hour spent copy-pasting content into ChatGPT is an hour you could've spent thinking.

Every time you lose context and have to re-explain everything is a creativity tax you shouldn't pay.

Every scattered Google Doc that your team can't find is organizational debt.

We built this because we felt that pain. And we know you do too.

This isn't about "disrupting" anything. It's about respecting your time and intelligence.

Try it. If it saves you even 30 minutes this week, we've done our job.

— [Founder Name]

## Implementation Notes

**Priority Order for MVP Landing Page**:
1. Headline + Sub-headline (pick 1 combo)
2. Hero demo (interactive or video)
3. CTA + assurances
4. Top 3 hero features
5. Pricing
6. FAQs
7. Contact info

**A/B Testing Recommendations**:
- Test 3 different headlines (pain-focused vs benefit-focused vs simplicity-focused)
- Test hero image (video demo vs screenshot vs interactive)
- Test CTA copy ("Start Free" vs "Try Now" vs "Create Canvas")
- Test pricing display order (Free first vs Team first)

**Voice & Tone Guidelines**:
- Conversational but not cutesy
- Technical when needed, simple by default
- Acknowledge the problem (messy AI workflows) without being negative
- Focus on time savings and better results
- Avoid: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "10x" (unless backed by data)
- Use: specific timeframes, concrete examples, real workflows
